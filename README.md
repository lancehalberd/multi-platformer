# multi-platformer
Experimenting with creating a multiplayer platformer

# setup
You will need `node` installed to run the server. I suggest following the instructions for installing `homebrew` and `node` here:
http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac

Once you have `node` installed, you should clone this repository if you haven't already done so:
`git clone git@github.com:lancehalberd/multi-platformer.git`

Then move to the new directory and install node packages (this may take a few minutes):
```
cd multi-platformer
npm install
```
For anyone who may not know, `npm` is "Node Package Manager".
It comes with `node` and you can use it to track 3rd party libraries.
It reads from a file called `package.json` which has details about the 3rd party code it should fetch.

Now you should be able to run the server using:
`node server`
If it works it should say something like:
`App listening on PORT 3000`
Then you should be able to view the game by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
